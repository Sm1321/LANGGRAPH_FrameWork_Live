It is a multidisciplinary approach that combines principles and practices from the fields of mathematics, statistics, artificial intelligence, and computer engineering to analyze large amounts of data. This analysis helps data scientists to ask and answer questions like what happened, why it happened, what will happen, and what can be done with the results. [...] While the terms may be used interchangeably, data analytics is a subset of data science. Data science is an umbrella term for all aspects of data processing—from the collection to modeling to insights. On the other hand, data analytics is mainly concerned with statistics, mathematics, and statistical analysis. It focuses on only data analysis, while data science is related to the bigger picture around organizational data.In most workplaces, data scientists and data analysts work together [...] ### What is the difference between data science and statistics?\\n\\nStatistics is a mathematically-based field that seeks to collect and interpret quantitative data. In contrast, data science is a multidisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, and systems to extract knowledge from data in various forms. Data scientists use methods from many disciplines, including statistics. However, the fields differ in their processes and the problems they study.',\n",
